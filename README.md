Feachers:

My start up idea is to have a program that helps organize your book collection, this program would allow you 
to add books that you have in your collection along with its associated price, author, languague, and volume 
number. You would be able to search for a spacific book if needed and remove a book from your collection if you lost it. The program would also allow other users that are on at the same time as you to see what book you 
had just added to your collection and vise versa. In the main screen it would show a list of all the books that you own with all their associated information. 

Start up pitch:

Having a large collection of books is great but it is also very hard esspecially if you constantly 
expanding it. You might find it difficult to remember what books you have or have not gotten. 
If the book is a part of a series then you could forget which volumes you have for that series. If you do 
forget then you could buy a book you already have thats no fun. So to solve this I am propossing a program 
that logs all your books and all the information associated with that book. If you are thinking about buying 
a books but you are not sure if you already have it, you could just login to the program and bam all your 
books are right there. With this the days of going to a books store looking at a shelf seeing a book you 
might want to buy and thinking, "do I alrealy have that?", this program will save you minutes in your life.
No more having to drive back to the book store to return the book you just bought. No more relizing that you 
lost the receipt so you can't return the book and just have to copys of the same book. No more gifting a your 
friend a random book that they have no interest compleatly randomly so you don't feel like you wasted your 
money buying a book you already have. This program will help the tens of people like me who have a very large 
collection of books. Now you might be wondering what this program would look like. Well to answer that I refer 
you to the "Picture" section.

HTML Project. Simon:

Make sure that you have know the link to your key so that you don't have to waste time looking it up everytime you want to make a change.

Use https:// if you want to go to an external site otherwise it will think you are using a file in your repository. 

Make a commit before you push your stuff or else you will have a hard time remembering what you did when you find a but
