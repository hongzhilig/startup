Paul is maing a commit

(but not really)

Gundam 00 is a really good series 

I like Trains

First Note: I learned that using git hub to store and orgonize all the changes that have been made within my 
code is very useful. Being able to esentaily put my code onto one github allows not only me but other people 
as wellt acess it form any computer. Being able to push update and then pull them to my computer allows me to
work with other and because it stores older version of the code if there is a mistake it is really simple to
go back to a privious state.
